#Assessment of Medicare Healthcare Fraud Data utilizing python and machine learning techniques
#Taken from BCBS, approx 3-10% of US healthcare spending or $68-$230 billion dollars are spent on fraudulent healthcare claims and management. 
#This is especially detrimental for those who require government assistance through systems like Medicare. 
#Government resources are already limited, alleviating pressures that occur from fraud may allow more freedom to help those in need. 
#Many of these fraudulent claims come in a variety of forms 
#a) Billing for services that were not provided.
#b) Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service.
#c) Misrepresenting the service provided.
#d) Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was actually provided.
#e) Billing for a covered service when the service actually provided was not covered.
#The Medicare data used for this analysis comes from Kaggle with the purpose of trying to identify problematic providers and those who are more likely to commit #healthcare fraud. 
#Understanding their behavioral patterns, along with how they relate to inpatient/outpatient care and claims can help the healthcare system save resources and devote #them to people who need them. 
#Over 1300 unique providers in the dataset and ~ 140,000 unique beneficiaries 
#Over 500,000 claims made between Nov 2008- Dec 2009
#Data categories like deductible paid, reimbursement amounts, provider identifiers, medical history etc.
